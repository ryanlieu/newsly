Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a delay of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation Tuesday given the ongoing FBI investigation into potential collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russian officials.

“You can bet, if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI, the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances,” Schumer said on the floor.

His call was later echoed by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted that FBI Director James Comey "testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion with Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait."

The emerging Democratic demand is highly unlikely to gain traction with Senate GOP leaders, who are planning a vote on Gorsuch early next month. But the move illustrates Schumer's interest in using the stain of an FBI probe to undercut the rest of Trump’s agenda and echoes entreaties by liberal groups that have pressured Democrats to filibuster Gorsuch.

Liberal groups increase pressure over Gorsuch nomination

The GOP blocked former President Barack Obama from naming Judge Merrick Garland to the high court last year when Obama faced no long-running federal inquiry, the New York Democrat added.

“It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,” Schumer said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee vetting Gorsuch this week, said he thinks the caucus is firmly united behind Schumer.

“There’s no more important decision we will make in this session” than voting on Gorsuch, Blumenthal said in an interview. “We ought to take all the time that is necessary. There’s no deadline for this decision.”

The liberal Center for American Progress also endorsed Schumer and Warren's delay push, as has the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America — a leading Gorsuch critic.

The Judiciary panel “must immediately pause any consideration of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination until the truth can come out,” NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement, a day after FBI Director James Comey confirmed the investigation in a high-profile hearing. “The American public deserves nothing less.”
